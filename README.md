A password generator is a tool that creates random and strong passwords for users.
1. Password generators work by using a random or pseudo-random number generator to create a string of characters that can include uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
2. The goal is to produce passwords that are highly secure and unique for every account, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving overall online security.
